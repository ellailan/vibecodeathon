Your perfectly baggy jeans, covered in mud at the hems. A pounding headache in a useless three-hour lab. 

Do you ever struggle to get out of bed in the morning, because really, what's the point? Commuting is so hard, but attendance is so important for academic weaponry...


# 🌅 **Rise & Decide**  
### *Because life is hard, but getting out of bed is harder.*
A predictive analytics tool that finally solves this crisis for UBC students.

Traditional decision-making is slow, unreliable, and emotionally biased.  
We knew there had to be a better way…  
…or at least a **less involved** way.

## 🤖 Our Solution  
We built the most over-engineered bed-leaving algorithm in human history.

**Rise & Decide** calculates a **morning importance score** using:

- ☁️ **Live Vancouver weather, pulled from an API**
- 😭 **A Mood slider**
- 🎓 **Course difficulty ranking**  
- 💕 **Crush-in-class multiplier**  
  (+200 points for the thrill of locking eyes)
- ⏰ **Time of day logic**  
  (“If it’s afternoon you already missed it”)

And then formats your decision in a way that's easy to copy and paste and share. Send one quick email to your favorite chill prof! Text all your friends that you won't be there with a blink of an eye! And in the meantime, share Rise and Decide with everyone who equally does not want to get out of bed.
